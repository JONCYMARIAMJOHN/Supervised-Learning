# Supervised-Learning
A python project which analyses the breast cancer dataset to predict the possibility of a person to become a patient depends upon several parameters. Here we have implemented several supervised classification algorithms to get the best result of prediction. 

## Implemented Algorithms
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
